```

### [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

### [Interger to English Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/)

​	Convert a non-negative integer to its english words representation. Given input is guaranteed to be less than 2^31 - 1.

**Example 4:**

```
Input: 1234567891
Output: "One Billion Two Hundred Thirty Four Million Five Hundred Sixty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety One"
```

### [Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)

Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ *n* (*n* = size of array), some elements appear **twice** and others appear **once**.

Find all the elements that appear **twice** in this array.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
